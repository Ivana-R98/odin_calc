The calculator project for TOP

# create a basic calculator 

## the calculator must be able to add, subtract, multiply, divide
    The result of the first two numbers is used as the frst number after the first calculation

### Create a new function operate that takes an operator and 2 numbers and then calls one of the above functions on the numbers
    the operate() function works if the two numbers exist, after pressing the buttons for +, -, /, * or = 

- Round answers with long decimals so that they don’t overflow the screen
- Pressing = before entering all of the numbers or an operator could cause problems
- Display a snarky error message if the user tries to divide by 0… don’t let it crash your calculator

#### Add a clear button
    Pressing “clear” should wipe out any existing data
#### Add a “backspace” button, so the user can undo if they click the wrong number.
#### Add a . button and let users input decimals! Make sure you don’t let them type more than one though
#### Add keyboard support
